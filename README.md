An open-source Flip'n Find! memory board game:
1. Users can play with the default icons (i have used comic book charactersðŸ˜…). Or,
2. play a custom game using photos from their phone.
3. Users can also download memory boards made by other players across the globe by entering the said game name.

Example custom game named "animals":
![animals](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02c181c5-b54d-45a6-b0f2-41223a3095f5)  ![animals1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc366ad-bcb5-41b3-8602-3bb81c170a2b)
